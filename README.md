### **Date :- 18-06-2024**
Course :- Java Masterclass on Udemy (Section 7)

- Classes & Objects
- Encapsulation
- Private instance variable and public methods
- Need of setter and getters (validation)
- static variables cannot be used inside non-static methods
- Constructors (default & parameterized)
- Constructors don't have a return type and their name is same as that of the class name
- If not declared explicitly, java create a default constructor during conversion of source code to byte code
- Constructor Overloading
- Constructor Chaining
- In Constructor chaining, the second constructor called inside first constructor needs to be the first statement inside the first  constructor.
