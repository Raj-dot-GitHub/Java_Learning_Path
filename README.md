# **What I learned in Java?**

Course :- Java Masterclass on Udemy (Section 7)

- Classes & Objects
- Encapsulation
- Private instance variable and public methods
- Need of setter and getters (validation)
- static variables cannot be used inside non-static methods
- Constructors (default & parameterized)
- Constructors don't have a return type and their name is same as that of the class name
- If not declared explicitly, java create a default constructor during conversion of source code to byte code
- Constructor Overloading
- Constructor Chaining
- In Constructor chaining, the second constructor called inside first constructor needs to be the first statement inside the first  constructor.

- Difference between objects(or instance) and reference variables
- Difference between static and instance variables
- static variables are class variables and they are used with class name (eg. House.rent)
- POJO (Plain Old Java Object), a special type of class used mainly to house instance variables (or data) and fewer methods to work with that data (getters or setters)
